For the timing procedures, trees have been constructed as follows.
Given k levels, (height - 1, assuming nodes with label '1' are of height
0), the procedure creates a full tree of order 3 with the following labeling
convention:  
								  					  
								  		 [  3  ]
								  	 /  	|	   \
								 [ 2 ]	  [	2 ]    [ 2 ]
								 / | \	  /	| \    / | \
							    1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1
							  
	preorder = 	3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1
	postorder = 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3

It was verified that the preorder, postorder and inorder traversals all
visit the nodes in the correct order. 

Everything works. Forgive the inconsistencies in the code, still learning.

Any other relevant information has been included in the code comments.
